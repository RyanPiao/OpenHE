# WindowCapture
This repo is test for my OpenHE Project, OpenHE is a universal haptic feedback solution for VR Games. In this program, I will mainly use Pywin32 to caputre series of screenshots to creat video feeds from VR games. I was able bump up FPS to 60 without using too much computer resources.
