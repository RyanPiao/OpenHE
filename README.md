# WindowCapture
This repo is test for my OpenHE Project, OpenHE is a universal haptic feedback solution for VR Games. In this program, I will mainly use Pywin32 to caputre series of screenshots to creat video feeds from VR games. As this moment, the FPS of window capture is about 40 to 50. (More than enough for OpenHE project)
